Dear recruiter and hiring managers:

Since joining Zendesk nearly three years ago, I have eagerly embraced every opportunity for growth. In my initial interview for my current role, I promised to never stop learning and focusing on personal development—something I have pursued consistently ever since.

Initially interviewed for a Tier 1 position, I was soon offered a Tier 2 interview, which required preparing a presentation around a chosen scenario, where I chose the API integration project.

For this, I developed a Python program to export Zendesk tickets into Excel spreadsheets that were emailed automatically, including incremental updates for ticket changes. This was my first coding project—prepared in just a week with no prior experience—and it marked the start of my journey into reading developer documentation and acquiring new technical skills I hadn’t imagined I had.

Committed to learning beyond daily tasks, I completed several courses and initiatives that gave me the confidence to approach any ticket, no matter the complexity. Today, I’m one of the top collaborators on the [#cs-global-swarm channel](https://zendesk.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C08RJTS4QLC), regularly receiving positive feedback from colleagues and my manager for assisting peers, sharing knowledge, and fostering team growth.

Early in my Zendesk career, I set my sights on making my way over to Tier 3. I’ve learned from top advocates, documented thorough troubleshooting steps in my tickets, and identified gaps in our documentation—actions I consider already operating at a Tier 3 level.

I created and delivered training on Omnichannel Routing (also collaborated for the recent Continuous learning training on OCR) and Email Authentication, and authored a detailed guide on Datadog’s relation to Zendesk services, expanding our knowledge base with valuable information previously unavailable.

Some examples of my contributions include:

- An [Omnichannel Routing presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZXjTR-aEZJOULzqdn3RKSTysV_EK-9kv6FRtDhrjgw/edit?usp=sharing) with flowcharts of basic functionality, delivered to my squad and APAC teams when no training was available.  
- An [Email Authentication presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NKrgkh56CBoD9AgSd9n-NhTDmZYP31-6A6hwzHhTYvk/edit?usp=sharing) presented to my squad and to recently promoted Tier 1 agents transitioning to Tier 2.  
- A [Datadog and related services document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G3bHPZZSfPCg4JKDwkiiZQnwedymgtoM6inuQ1eaNgQ/edit?usp=sharing) outlining the connections between Datadog data and Zendesk services.

I have received several recognitions via Workday feedback for these collaborations, including thanks from mentees I supported during onboarding and recent T2 promoted agents.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute further in this role. Thank you for your consideration.
